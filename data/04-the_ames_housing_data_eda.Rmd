# Textbook's EDA

## Map

Let's start with the coolest thing in the chapter! 

Color is Neighborhood, Size is Sale_Price
```{r}
nb.cols <- 28
mycolors <- colorRampPalette(RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(8, "Set2"))(nb.cols)

pal <- colorFactor(
  palette = mycolors,
  levels = levels(ames$Neighborhood)
)

leaflet(ames) %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(lng = ~Longitude, 
                   lat = ~Latitude, 
                   opacity = NULL, 
                   radius = ~Sale_Price / 60000, 
                   color = ~pal(Neighborhood), 
                   group = ~Neighborhood, 
                   popup = ~paste(Neighborhood, dollar(Sale_Price))) %>% 
  addLayersControl(overlayGroups =  ames$Neighborhood,
                   options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE))

```

Textbook points out:

1. Isolated neighbourhoods (Timberland)
2. Neighbourhoods that are surrounded by others (Meadow Village, Bloomington Heights)
3. Overlapping neighbourhoods (Sommerset, Old Town)
4. Out-of-place houses within neighbourhoods (Crawford, Veenker)

## Sale_Price

```{r}
ames %>% 
  summarize(mean(Sale_Price))
```

```{r}
ggplot(ames, aes(x = Sale_Price)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 50) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = min(ames$Sale_Price), color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = dollar_format()) +
  labs(title = "Sale_Price shows a right skewed distribution",
       subtitle = "Notice the minimum Sale_Price is above 0")
```

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(ames, aes(x = Sale_Price)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 50) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = dollar_format()) +
  labs(title = "Log Transformed Sale_Price, looks normal")

p2 <- ames %>%
  mutate(Sale_Price = log10(Sale_Price)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Sale_Price)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 50) +
  scale_x_continuous() +
  labs(title = "Log Transformed Sale_Price, looks normal")

p1 + p2
```

# Let's do some EDA

## What kind of Columns do I have?

```{r}
ames %>% 
  skimr::skim()
```

This is quite a lot of columns. It'd take a long time to go through them one by one.
__Ask the group what their strategies are with large feature sets__

### Strategy 1. Look at similar columns together ("Area", "SF", "Cond")

```{r}
ames %>% names()
ames %>% select(matches("Area"))
```

1.1 Faceted histogram of numeric variables using pivot_longer (can also sample columns)
```{r}
ames %>% 
  select(matches("SF")) %>% 
  mutate(id = row_number()) %>% 
  pivot_longer(-id, "measure", "value") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(value, fill = measure)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50) +
  facet_wrap(~measure, scales = "free")
```

1.2 Faceted count column chart of categorical variables using reorder_within 
```{r}
ames %>% 
  select(matches("Cond")) %>% 
  select(-Second_Flr_SF) %>% 
  mutate(id = row_number()) %>% 
  pivot_longer(-id, "measure", "value") %>% 
  count(measure, value) %>% 
  mutate(value = reorder_within(value, n, measure)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(n, value, fill = measure)) + 
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(~measure, scales = "free_y") + 
  scale_y_reordered()
```


### Strategy 2. Create a Correlation map
```{r}
library(ggcorrplot)

# Just taking numeric for now
corr <- round(cor(ames %>% select(where(is.numeric))), 1)
plotly::ggplotly(ggcorrplot(corr, type = "lower"))
```

## Question1: Which neighbourhoods sell the most and at what price?

Column graph of house counts by neighbourhood, filled by median price
```{r}
ames %>% 
  group_by(Neighborhood) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(), median_price = median(Sale_Price)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(Neighborhood = fct_reorder(Neighborhood, n)) %>%  
  ggplot(aes(n, Neighborhood, fill = median_price)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_continuous(labels = dollar_format()) +
  labs(title = "# houses sold by neighbourhood, represented by median Sale_Price",
       x = "# Houses Sold")
```

Boxplot of price distribution by neighbourhood
```{r}
ames %>% 
  mutate(Neighborhood = fct_reorder(Neighborhood, Sale_Price, median)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Sale_Price, Neighborhood, fill = Neighborhood)) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Sale_Price distribution by neighbourhood")
```

## Question2: Which neighbourhoods have the oldest houses? Does it affect Price?

geom_density_ridges chart year built by neighbourhoods 
```{r}
library(ggridges)

ames %>% 
  mutate(Neighborhood = fct_reorder(Neighborhood, Year_Built, median)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(Year_Built, Neighborhood, fill = Neighborhood)) +
  geom_density_ridges(show.legend = FALSE)
```

Scatter plot year vs price
```{r}
ames %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Year_Built, Sale_Price)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

Calculate median Sale_Price by decades __thank you drob for this trick!__
```{r}
ames %>% 
  mutate(decade = 10 * (Year_Built %/% 10)) %>% 
  group_by(decade) %>% 
  summarize(price = median(Sale_Price)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(decade, price)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Median home sale price by decades")
```


## Further EDA questions:
- Some people have no fence? Are these apartments?
- How many people have pools?
- Year Built vs Renovation vs Sold
- Are older homes bigger?
- Is there a popular Bldg_Type in an area?
